This is a repository of the tetrad of surreal stories named "The devilism essence or Materials of the Case of Mister N."

It is a series of books being continupusly updated and edited since 2014.

Books one and two were tyed with PC in 2014-2015. 

Book three was written manually with a notebook, pen and pencil. And then typed manually. This book was main work in 2016-2018 approximatelly. Until in 2019-2020 it was finally digitized and initial manuscript was burned. In some of instagram accounts still remains a video. But I don't remember which one was it... 

Anyway, manuscripts do not burn.

Book 1 became a priority in terms of editing and stylizing the text. Relatively recent 2023-2024 the first book is finally more or less ready for publication. 

Book four is being written manually with a pen and an actual paper book. 

There is no AI in play. It is purely a human made piece of literature. 

And it is living. The tetrad is supported by a game, which is described in another repo and in synopsis. 

I couldn't imagine a better case of events for myself as a writer to become able to work with my texts with AI as a programmer. 

However, I decide to keep to my own authorship over my books. Everything I write and publish as books is my manual work. Sometimes it is even crafted or made physically for its own sake.

It is more exciting to go and make your own ink, your own pen and your own paper than buying anything. 

Ink making is an ancient craft. In Japan inks can cost big money and take time to prepare. 

This is much like alchemy. It continues in texts as information. 

This is why the organisation is called Krasnomakov Bureau Info. It produces information. 

In many ways. 

Art can produce or transform energy through feelings. Information can as well. 

Feelings, emotions - these can transform matter, change our bodies. Thoughts can on their own too. Yet, art is often associated more with emotions and feelings. 

About writing it is definitle in science and science fiction.

Surrealism is something that can live in between and go beyond these categories. It is a truly mystical direction in art, culture and science (cognitive sciences).

Surrealism is known as a combination of dream and reality. And this is an underresearched area for both scientists and artists. 

Thus, it is something positive for the civilization. Similar to The Herald of Coming Good by G. as I see it. 

No!

It is similar to the Tales of Beelzebub to his grandson by G. !
