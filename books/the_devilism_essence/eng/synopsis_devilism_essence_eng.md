**The devilism essence or Materials of the Case of Mister N.**

The tetrad of surrealistic stories by Artur Krasnomakov-Paukovsky is a work overloaded with meanings, resembling the Bible and the Quran in its structure, written in the style of "Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson" by George Gurdjieff.

The four books correspond to the four Gospels and narrate the life of Mr. N, his path to attaining consciousness and transforming his inner and outer world into something more perfect.

Just as in the Gospel, the same period of time (N.'s life) is described, but from different points of view and with emphasis on different qualities and details. Moreover, the initiatic structure is preserved - the first book is for the outer circle of people (the uninitiated), the second for those seeking initiation (neophytes), the third for brothers, and the fourth for masters.

Together they create a cosmology that takes into account the development of modern technologies and events of the recent past.

This book is likened to the Quran in that each of its Chapters is a self-sufficient work, like a sura or ayah of the Quran. Besides this, it contains many other internal patterns and interconnections.

As the reader delves deeper into reading the book, they receive clear instructions on what needs to be done to develop a higher state of consciousness and evolve as a result of conscious work. Nevertheless, the book is encrypted and complicated and is not a textbook or direct instruction for such actions.

It describes the path of a person, which allows drawing a parallel between the main character and the reader and finding something similar in one's own life.

The reality of the book is mystical and surreal - it's unclear where fiction ends and reality begins. It's as if the everyday world is described from such a perspective that humanity has yet to comprehend, and what is described is kept secret. This style provides a unique reading experience. Already during reading, the reader will be able to feel a change in perception of familiar reality and change their attitude toward it. The book is a portal, a source of wisdom and inspiration.

Its special structure unfolds even deeper in the transformational game "Mystical Journey." The game and books are interconnected. In the game, the player is invited to set some important life goal and through the game receive insight or providence for achieving it.

The game field is a dodecagram divided into four realities or four enneagrams. To take one correct step in real life, the player must work through the enneagram of alternative reality or take 6 steps in it. Each task or each card for a move is an excerpt from the book, which in hidden form and with the help of game mechanics gives the player a message, like an oracle.

Such combination and achievement of effect are possible thanks to the special language in which the book is written and its special internal structure. The text affects a person's perception of reality and changes it.

A similar approach was used by George Gurdjieff in the book "Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson." In it, he used many new words created by himself and through Beelzebub's speeches described cosmology. Reading this book, the reader could clearly be convinced that there are much more facets of reality than are usually accessible to them. Besides this, they learned about such an arrangement of the universe that is rarely described elsewhere. Moreover, the book affects neural connections, as one has to encounter the unfamiliar and new.

Thus, the Gospel, Quran, and Beelzebub's Tales served as inspiration for writing the surrealistic stories of the tetrad "The devilism essence".

The main idea of this book is to expose the diabolical nature of the modern world and through describing the transformation path of the main character, provide the reader with an effective tool for liberation from the self-serving forces controlling the world.

This book is not an ode to the devil, not a glorification of satan, but on the contrary, an exposure of the underbelly and interpretation of what is happening. It clearly correlates with modern history and will be useful to modern people, as it touches on eternal themes in the context of modernity.

A book with an enormous amount of meanings, revealing itself differently in different situations, being an oracle, capable of giving a person advice and adapting to their level of development. It definitely describes living themes that were, are, and will be relevant to humanity.

The book represents a cosmos, dividing reality into 4 parts. At the center of this cosmos is a state of balance toward which the cosmos strives.

A person is likened to the cosmos, the main character is the cosmos. His 4 parts are his name, or how the world named and sees him (first book), what he wants to see himself as or his pseudonym (second book), Nobody or his unconscious part (third book), and his true "I" (fourth book)... This metaphysics is symbolically expressed in such a sign, which unfolds and appears at the end of the third book.

The first book is accessible, it lures into a trap. The second book is complex, its first chapters are a test for the seeker of truth. They seriously develop attention and concentration. At the same time, they teach how to be in several places simultaneously. The third book gives understanding, gives refuge. And the fourth book reveals the essence.

The idea of the tetrad is built on the conceptual philosophy of time developed by the author. Essentially, the tetrad of surrealistic stories is an artistic representation of philosophy.

The entire world is a manifestation of universal time, whose nature is described in the first book. The metaphysical basis of this time is a unified and indivisible crystal. And the surrounding world is a manifestation of archetypes of the flow of time, which in integral unification form all existence. Archetypes are present in everything, which makes all things to some degree similar to Time. How to understand this Time? What means can we use to comprehend it? Answers to this question are not revealed in the book, or are revealed partially. Nevertheless, reading it itself is comprehension of Time, as these books represent a harmonious structure.

Each story has 3 parts of 12 chapters each. Each part corresponds to active, passive, and neutralizing forces. And 12 is the musical octave, represented as 12 semitones. According to George Gurdjieff, for anything to exist in the universe, the unification of these three forces is necessary. And everything can be divided into 7 parts, like 7 notes. The entire world is vibrations. These two principles were united by him in the enneagram.

The enneagram is the foundation of the author's philosophy. He develops this idea, going to Time and creating a dodecagram, connecting 4 enneagrams and dividing space-time so that it becomes nonlinear.

This is literally transmitted through the book. Reading it, one immerses in such a state where the law of similarity turns everything into Time, which flows in all directions and can stop.

The book is written as excerpts from a criminal case or court protocol. Most of all, its presentation resembles excerpts from a personal file in the KGB, FBI, or other special services. The entire description is conducted from the side of a third observer, whose nature is not human. One gets the impression that the description is conducted by a super-intelligent being who has access to a broader and deeper understanding of reality than humans. And only sometimes quotes or excerpts are given that immerse the reader in the world of the work.

It's noticeable that the one who describes the occurring events knows about what is unknown and cannot be known to an ordinary person. Perhaps this is even a mind not from our planet. And reading the book brings one closer to the state of this other mind. At the same time, the practically protocol language doesn't allow relaxation and creates a state of alertness, giving seriousness to everything happening.

The series "The devilism essence" consists of four books about the path to achieving a high state of consciousness by one representative of the human species in the harsh realities of Artur Krasnomakov-Paukovsky's surrealistic world. This is a world in which forces of evil and cunning struggle for dominance. Forces of good are excluded or defeated, their influence is practically imperceptible. Only certain special influences of those people are present who have reached the central point in the theme of spreading influence, and not some specific one, but any of all that exist. These people are like tricksters, they act so that no one can understand what is really happening. The intentions of tricksters are not catchable and predicting their next step is not possible. Accordingly, one cannot determine to which of the groupings of general forces of abstract evil they belong, just as one cannot deny that they may also represent forces of abstract good, of which almost nothing remains.
