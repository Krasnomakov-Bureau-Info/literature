They shoot. From afar.

At the edge of the forest.

No one is nearby.

Each has a pouch of bullets. And powder in powder flasks.

Fastened to their belts and backpacks.

The first shots miss.

Second, third.

They move across the field, but don't come close.

They load bullets by hand, pour in powder, ram everything down with ramrods, and shoot again.

And so it goes on for 2 hours.

Eventually, one runs out of ammo.

He puts on a bayonet and goes to attack hand-to-hand.

The second shooter starts reloading faster.

Reloading takes up to 2 minutes.
