At first, a disembodied spirit hovered over the water.

It hovered and laughed. Literally.

It's something like a cloud, ethereal and with lightning, with all sorts of waves.

And so it hovers over the water, and the water changes a bit because of it. Sometimes a lot.

The idea with this spirit is that it can hover. But it has no coordinate system. That's why the process is chaotic.

But there is already something individual about it.

This was better expressed later in the horse.

That's a dense spirit. And it also hovers and neighs. And behaves just as chaotically, kicking and galloping.

In ancient times, you could still meet such spirits on land.

Like big jellyfish, but freer, lighter, they would fly into the jungle. And there they would settle or keep flying.
