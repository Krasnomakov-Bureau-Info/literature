- We decided to do something serious. Something real. Something big.

- Is it this cabinet?

- It's not a cabinet. (Presses a button and the front of a black parallelepiped the size of a person and a meter thick opens. Inside is a 10-liter bottle of whiskey. And glasses. And on the lower tier, another 50-liter barrel for refilling.)

- Looks serious.

- We didn't stop there. In addition to the canister, we also put in a container with barrels. But there was nowhere to store it. So we took it to the warehouse.
