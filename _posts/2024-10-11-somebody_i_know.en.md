"Yes, yes, yes." — that's how they talk, nodding their head.

And the stench is so strong it rings in your ears. It's like something bursts in your brain. Sharp, like a spotlight in your eyes. And it hurts.

Just the stench.

Can you imagine?

They come in, and immediately there's this sharp smell. It hits your senses terribly. You can't even stand, your legs buckle.

It slaps you. Like something explodes. And so loud, it feels like your eardrums are about to burst.

But they don't. And the stench just keeps coming and coming.
