My job is to plant fake evidence.

Somewhere I bury artificially aged artifacts.

Somewhere I tweak a historical map.

I'll reissue and age a print run of encyclopedias with the right facts.

And as for digital sources, AI does it all for me now.

Have you read about the Priory of Sion?

It's a fancy job, really. I'm not the first, not even the first in my generation.

We have something like a guild.

Everything is made, created.

The worldview must be controlled. Any options will do here.

Need a dinosaur skull? You'll get it. Need information from secret bunkers about something dangerous that can't exist? You'll get that too.
